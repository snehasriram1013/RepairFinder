      <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
      <p>
        On busy campuses, maintenance requests can get lost in the outdated system, and take too much time to get resolved. 
        <strong>RepairFinder</strong> centralizes everything into a simple ticketing system,
        so students can report issues in seconds, and facilities staff can track and resolve
        them efficiently.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Use</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Log in</strong> with your student or admin account (top-right user icon).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Students:</strong> Click “Add Ticket” in the sidebar, fill out the form,
          and hit Submit. You can view your open requests under “My Tickets.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Admins:</strong> Head to the “Admin Dashboard” to see every ticket,
          sorted by urgency. Click a ticket to view details or update its status.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the <strong>Search</strong> box on the Dashboard to filter by keywords,
          building, or urgency level.
        </li>
        <li>
          When a repair is complete, admins can close or delete the ticket to keep the queue fresh.
        </li>
      </ol>
