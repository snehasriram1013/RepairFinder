# RepairFinder
RepairFinder Semester Project

Overview:
- RepairFinder is a broken facilities reporting app designed to streamline the repair request/resolution process within college campus communities.

Created by:
- Sneha Sriram, Quareebah Anifowoshe, Lily Millard

Status (new since Alpha):
- We have finished implementing login and sessions, searching the database, updating tickets, uploading images with tickets, and individual ticket pages.
- Ticket searching allows the user to search by keyword within ticket description (optional), with filters for building and urgency (required).
- The image upload feature allows users to include/update images associated with tickets
- Login/sessions allows for functionality of "my tickets" page, which gets all tickets created by a particular user, and locks the majority of pages with required login

Status (overall):
- We have completed a large portion of our original goal. If we had more time, we would have been able to incorporate an admin page sorted by priority and a map interface. Additionally, admins would have select privileges (ex. resolving ticket) that are currently available to all users (**NOTE: current "About" page assumes full functionality with admin login)

Directions for use:
1. Log in with your student account
2. To insert a new repair request, click “Add Ticket” in the sidebar, fill out the form, and hit Submit. You can view your open requests under “My Tickets.”
3. Within the sidebar, click "Home" to go to the dashboard of all open tickets. This has a search bar that allows for filtering of tickets by keywords, building, or urgency level.
4. Click on any ticket to view its details, and/or make edits to its information
5. You can close or delete the ticket to keep the queue fresh using the check box on each dashboard ticket
